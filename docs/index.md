Notes about research papers will be posted at this site.  File an issue at this [repo](https://github.com/songmuhan/songmuhan.github.io) or email songmuhan@stu.pku.edu.cn if you have any suggestion. 

I am currently focusing on Computer System and Architecture, especially **virtualization** and performance evaluation of microprocessor.
